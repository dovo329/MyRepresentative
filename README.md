# MyRepresentative
Uses http://whoismyrepresentative.com/api to find a user's federal representatives. 

Warning, the api's database is not up to date (shows Jim Matheson instead of Mia Love)!  

Also, in at least the case of Jaime Herrera Beutler, last name search doesn't work (this is a problem in the api, not the app).  Tried hypenating the last two names, or putting a %20 in between, or just the last name, but doesn't show up.
